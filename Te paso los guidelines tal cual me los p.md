Te paso los guidelines tal cual me los pas√≥ Bryon asi no cometo errores:

.- Implement a shell laravel application in 8
I understand that i have to use laravel 8, is that correct?

.-Take the functions provided and implement it with a post API call to projects/get-documents

.-Nothing about the function is set in stone, please change it in a way that you think is correct

.-Implement the function using a standard laravel approach

.-It is not important that the function works just that it looks like it would work

.-Maintain the original functionality whilst making it more readable
